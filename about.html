				<h2> About FindPhoto</h2>
				We buy and sell images. We buy 50,000 images and we sell 35,000 images every day.
				</br>
				Sourced from photographers and from you. 
				</br>
				We pay our photographers a higher percentage of the sale than other componies and it’s easy to get your images online.

					<h3>Sell to FindPhoto</h3>
					We’re easy to work with, we’re non-exclusive and we don’t tie our contributors in with long-term contracts. 
					</br>
					We don’t edit our collection either so our contributors can choose what they want to sell.
					</br>
					This leads to a more diverse collection and less hoops for our artists to jump through.
					</br>
					But we also believe in a fairer world by giving higher commissions splits than our core competitors.
					</br>
					Our ‘100% students’ project supports photography students while they study. 
					</br>
					We give students 100% of the money they make from the sale of their images on FindPhoto.

					<h3>FindPhoto Mission</h3>
					In a world where millions of images are taken every day, there are still stories that have yet to be told. 
					</br>
					Our mission is to leave no image unseen.
</br>
					That’s why we don’t believe in editing our photographers.
</br>
					They dictate the market by uploading whatever they want so that we can empower
</br>
					our customers and let them decide what deserves airtime and what doesn’t.
</br>
					Everyone should be heard. All we need is for you to tell their story.
